## üë© Set up instructions for Anyscale 

There is nothing you need to setup, as the Anyscale hosted environment will provide everything:
all notebooks for each class, data files, and all relevant python packages will be installed on 
the cluster.

However, consider cloning or downloading a release of the tutorial notebooks and 
supporting software from the [Ray Summit training repo](https://github.com/anyscale/ray-summit-2022-training), 
so you have a local copy of everything.
