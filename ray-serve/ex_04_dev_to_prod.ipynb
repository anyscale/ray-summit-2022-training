    "# Development to Production Workflow in Ray Serve\n",

    "\n",
    "### Learning Objective:\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    " * operationalize your model into production\n",
    " * run Serve interactively from a terminal\n",
    " * use the `serve` command-line interface (CLI) to update deployment configs \n",
    " * use the `serve` CLI to query and monitor model deployment status\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have learned about the fundamentals of Ray Serve and its deployment graph feature, let's take a look at how can you operate it in production. So far, the only API you've learned is calling `serve.run(node)` in Python to interactively deploy a deployment graph to a local Ray cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main environment you will be working with will be the terminal instead of a notebook. The terminal will be the primary environment to perform operations in the production workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the terminal in few ways:\n",
    "- Click the \"+\" button in the file browser and select \"Terminal\" in the launcher tab. This will create a terminal within the [Jupyter environment](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/terminal.html). \n",
    "- Switch back to your Anyscale cluster page and use the embedded terminal.\n",
    "- For a one-off command, you can prefix it with `!` and run it in a Python code cell in this notebook. This is not suitable for long-running commands that require `Ctrl+C` to exit, because it will block the execution of subsequent cells."
