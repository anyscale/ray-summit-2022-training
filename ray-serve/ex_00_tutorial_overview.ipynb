    "## About This Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a two-part tutorial. The first part will focus on [Ray Serve](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/index.html) is a framework-agnostic and Python-first machine learning model serving library built on Ray. This tutorial will cover how Ray Serve makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale a machine learning model using Ray Serve APIs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second part is an introduction to [Ray AI Runtime](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/ray-air/getting-started.html). Ray AI Runtime (AIR) is an open-source toolkit for building end-to-end ML applications. We will discuss the merits of Ray AIR and how its key concepts and components allow to take your simple and scalable use cases and scale it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key learnings:\n",
    " \n",
    "* üë© Understand Ray Serve architecture, components, and flow of requests across replicas\n",
    "* üìñ Learn how to use Ray Serve APIs to create, access, and deploy your models and mechanisms to access model deployments via Python APIs and HTTP endpoints\n",
    "* üßë‚ÄçüíªImplement common model deployment patterns for serving ML models using the inference graph API as a directed acyclic graph (DAG)\n",
    "* üìà Scale up/down individual components of an inference graph node, utilizing appropriate hardware resources (GPUs/CPUs) and replicas\n",
    "* üéõ Inspect load and deployments in a Ray dashboard\n",
    "* ‚öôÔ∏è  ML development/deployment with Ray AI Runtime (Ray AIR)\n",
    "\n",
    "Divided into three modules, each module will take about an hour, combined with lecture and followed by \n",
    "hands-on üë©‚Äçüíª exercises in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the instructions in the [README](../README.md) for setting up your environment to use this tutorial."
