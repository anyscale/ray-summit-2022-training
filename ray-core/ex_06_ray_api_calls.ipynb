If this address is not provided, then this command will start Redis, a raylet, a plasma store, a plasma manager, and some workers. It will also kill these processes when Python exits. If the driver is running on a node in a Ray cluster, using `auto` as the value tells the driver to detect the the cluster, removing the need to specify a specific node address. |\n",
    "| `num_cpus` | `int` | `num_cpus=4` | Number of CPUs the user wishes to assign to each _raylet_. |\n",

    "| `resources` | `dictionary` | `resources={'resource1': 4, 'resource2': 16}` | Maps the names of custom resources to the quantities of those resources available. |\n",
    "| `memory` | `int` | `memory=1000000000` | The amount of memory (in bytes) that is available for use by workers requesting memory resources. By default, this is automatically set based on the available system memory. |\n",
    "| `object_store_memory` | `int` | `object_store_memory=1000000000` | The amount of memory (in bytes) for the object store. By default, this is automatically set based on available system memory, subject to a 20GB cap. |\n",
    "| `log_to_driver` | `bool` | `log_to_driver=True` | If true, then the output from all of the worker processes on all nodes will be directed to the driver program. |\n",
    "| `local_mode` | `bool` | `local_mode=True` | If true, the code will be executed serially. This is useful for debugging. |\n",
    "| `ignore_reinit_error` | `bool` | `ignore_reinit_error=True` | If true, Ray suppresses errors from calling `ray.init()` a second time (as we've done in these notebooks). Ray won't be restarted. |\n",

    "| `max_calls` | `int` | `max_calls=5` | Only for *remote tasks*. This specifies the maximum of times that a given worker can execute the given remote function before it must exit (this can be used to address memory leaks in third-party libraries or to reclaim resources that cannot easily be released, e.g., GPU memory that was acquired by TensorFlow). By default this is infinite. |\n",
    "| `max_restarts` | `int` | `max_restarts=-1` | Only for *actors*. This specifies the maximum number of times that the actor should be restarted when it dies unexpectedly. The minimum valid value is 0 (default), which indicates that the actor doesn't need to be restarted. A value of -1 indicates that an actor should be restarted indefinitely. |\n",
    "| `max_task_retries` | `int` | `max_task_retries=-1` | Only for *actors*. How many times to retry an actor task if the task fails due to a system error, e.g., the actor has died. If set to -1, the system will retry the failed task until the task succeeds, or the actor has reached its max_restarts limit. If set to n > 0, the system will retry the failed task up to n times, after which the task will throw a `RayActorError` exception upon `ray.get`. Note that Python exceptions are not considered system errors and will not trigger retries. |\n",
    "| `max_retries` | `int` | `max_retries=-1` | Only for *remote functions*. This specifies the maximum number of times that the remote function should be rerun when the worker process executing it crashes unexpectedly. The minimum valid value is 0, the default is 4 (default), and a value of -1 indicates infinite retries. |\n",
    "| `runtime_envs` | `dict` | `{\"working_dir\": \"/path/to/files\"}` | Your Ray application might depend on source files or data files. For a development workflow, these might live on your local machine, but when it comes time to run things at scale, you will need to get them to your remote cluster.
