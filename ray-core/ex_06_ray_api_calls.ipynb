    "| Name | Type | Example | Description |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :------ | :---------- |\n",
    "| `address` | `str` | `address='auto'` | The address of the Ray cluster to connect to. If this address is not provided, then this command will start Redis, a raylet, a plasma store, a plasma manager, and some workers. It will also kill these processes when Python exits. If the driver is running on a node in a Ray cluster, using `auto` as the value tells the driver to detect the the cluster, removing the need to specify a specific node address. |\n",
    "| `num_cpus` | `int` | `num_cpus=4` | Number of CPUs the user wishes to assign to each _raylet_. |\n",

    "| `resources` | `dictionary` | `resources={'resource1': 4, 'resource2': 16}` | Maps the names of custom resources to the quantities of those resources available. |\n",
    "| `memory` | `int` | `memory=1000000000` | The amount of memory (in bytes) that is available for use by workers requesting memory resources. By default, this is automatically set based on the available system memory. |\n",
    "| `object_store_memory` | `int` | `object_store_memory=1000000000` | The amount of memory (in bytes) for the object store. By default, this is automatically set based on available system memory, subject to a 20GB cap. |\n",
    "| `log_to_driver` | `bool` | `log_to_driver=True` | If true, then the output from all of the worker processes on all nodes will be directed to the driver program. |\n",
    "| `local_mode` | `bool` | `local_mode=True` | If true, the code will be executed serially. This is useful for debugging. |\n",
    "| `ignore_reinit_error` | `bool` | `ignore_reinit_error=True` | If true, Ray suppresses errors from calling `ray.init()` a second time (as we've done in these notebooks). Ray won't be restarted. |\n",
    "| `include_webui` | `bool` | `include_webui=False` | Boolean flag indicating whether or not to start the web UI, which displays the status of the Ray cluster. By default, or if this argument is `None`, then the UI will be started if the relevant dependencies are present. |\n",
    "| `webui_host` | _address_ | `webui_host=1.2.3.4` | The host to bind the web UI server to. Can either be `localhost` (or `127.0.0.1`) or `0.0.0.0` (available from all interfaces). By default, this is set to `localhost` to prevent access from external machines. |\n",

    "| `logging_level` | _Flag_ | `logging_level=logging.INFO` | The logging level, defaults to `logging.INFO`. Ignored unless \"configure_logging\" is true. |\n",
    "| `logging_format` | `str` | `logging_format='...'` | The logging format to use, defaults to a string containing a timestamp, filename, line number, and message. See the Ray source code `ray_constants.py` for details. Ignored unless \"configure_logging\" is true. |\n",
    "| `temp_dir` | `str` | `temp_dir=/tmp/myray` | If provided, specifies the root temporary directory for the Ray process. Defaults to an OS-specific conventional location, e.g., `/tmp/ray`. |\n",
    "| `runtime_env` | `map` | `{\"working_dir\": \"/path/to/files\"}` | Your Ray application might depend on source files or data files. For a development workflow, these might live on your local machine, but when it comes time to run things at scale, you will need to get them to your remote cluster. A way to send these files across all nodes in the cluster so that your distributed tasks or actors can access them, use this option, [for example.]() |"

This specifies the maximum of times that a given worker can execute the given remote function before it must exit (this can be used to address memory leaks in third-party libraries or to reclaim resources that cannot easily be released, e.g., GPU memory that was acquired by TensorFlow). By default this is infinite. |\n",
    "| `max_restarts` | `int` | `max_restarts=-1` | Only for *actors*. This specifies the maximum number of times that the actor should be restarted when it dies unexpectedly. The minimum valid value is 0 (default), which indicates that the actor doesn't need to be restarted. A value of -1 indicates that an actor should be restarted indefinitely. |\n",

If set to -1, the system will retry the failed task until the task succeeds, or the actor has reached its max_restarts limit. If set to n > 0, the system will retry the failed task up to n times, after which the task will throw a `RayActorError` exception upon `ray.get`. Note that Python exceptions are not considered system errors and will not trigger retries. |\n",
    "| `max_retries` | `int` | `max_retries=-1` | Only for *remote functions*. This specifies the maximum number of times that the remote function should be rerun when the worker process executing it crashes unexpectedly.
